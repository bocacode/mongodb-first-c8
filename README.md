# Boca Code's simple MongoDB example

We will be using the "Sample Database" provided by mongoDB Atlas (cloud.mongodb.com)

We will show you one way to: 
- Simple Query for one movie
- Searching for all movies with a particular word in it (ignoring upper and lower case)
- Inserting a new movie
- Updating the new movie
- Updating all movies with a particularly complex query and increasing a numerical value the correct way.
